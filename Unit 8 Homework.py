    # Question 1 -- Intersection of Two Sets

        # Given A = [4, 9, 16, 25, 36] and B = [9, 21, 23, 25]
        # What is the intersection of A and B

        # 9, 25 XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        # 4, 9, 16, 21, 23, 25, 36
        # 4, 16, 35
        # none of the above

    # Question 2 -- Difference of two sets

        # What is B\A?

        # 21, 23, XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        # 4, 16, 36
        # 9, 21, 23, 25
        # none of the above

    # Question 3 -- Complement as a difference

        # Define the complement of set A using the set difference operator
