NumPy
--------------------------
NumPy is a library that needs to be imported
import numpy as np
  assigns np as a variable -- shorthand

using from numpy import * imports everything and can overwrite the built in function

arange generates a range array instead of a list
  np.arange(100000) <-- range of values up to 100,000

  when dealing with large ranges of values, an array will be more performant than a range

  np.sum(ARRAY) is faster than sum(LIST)

Leveraging an Array
---------------------------
leveraging .shape will indicate the format of the array

reshape allows you to change the shape of an array
  arr.reshape((6, 6)) <-- converts the array to 6 rows and 6 columns

  you can call the shape of a reshape
    arr.reshape((6, 6)).shape

  you can split an array into multiple arrays by adding a third command
    arr.reshape((3, 3, -1))
      ^^^ -1 removes the last row in the array so there are no trailing values

a numpy array is mutuable but you cannot reshape the array
    using the reshape command creates a new object in memory

can perform arithmetics on an array
    arr * 3 <---- multiples all values by 3

should avoid looping through an array

.flatten -- returns the array to a single array in one row
  arr.flatten()

iterating through a list and an array with a for loop will yield about the same performance
