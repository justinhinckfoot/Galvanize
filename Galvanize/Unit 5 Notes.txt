Unit 5 Notes -- Python Functions

    ◦ Classroom Notes
        ▪ functions allow you to reference the same logic in multiple places and only have one entry where the code needs to be updated to impact all references
            • similar to a variable
        ▪ a return() statement needs to be added after the function to return the result
        ▪ you can include a variable, n, to the get_events() function to be referenced hwithin the function itself
def get_evens(n, start):
evens = []
for element in range(start, n):
    if element % 2 == 0:
        evens.append(element)

return(evens)
        ▪ functions can use various data types (strings, ints, etc.)
        ▪ can default a variable to a value and override it if a value is provided
            • get_evens(n, start=0)
            • can reverse the order but then need to define the value you’re setting
                ◦ get_evens(start=25, n=100)
        ▪ can manipulate a single value with a function:
def FUNCTION(VALUE):
return(VALUE+MANIPULATION)
          FUNCTION(value)
        ▪ including a question mark at the end of a function brings up the help info
            • you can include a docstring for a custom function by entering the values within triple quotes
        ▪ can return multiple values by separating them with a comma
            • returns them as a tuple by default
        ▪ can include if statements in a functions
            • don’t need to add an else statement, simply enter down out of the if statement to continue the logic
        ▪ can test the data type of a variable by using the isinstance() function
            • isinstance(VALUE, TYPE)
            • should try and avoid type checking wherever possible
        ▪ can also include while and for loops within a function
        ▪ scope rules
            • within the current function’s scope
            • any enclosing scope
            • the scope of the module (global scope)
            • the built-in scope
                ◦ acts as a catch all if you use a variable name that is also a built in function (len)
                    ▪ if len() does not exist as a variable then it will return the function len() values
        ▪ can save a formula as a .py file and then import it to be used in other statements
            • these are modules
            • can be turned into scripts
        ▪ sys – built in library to Python
            • need to first import then so that you can use them
            • import sys
        ▪ run python from the terminal but starting the command with python
            • can then call the file directly
            • python give_me_evens.py VARIABLES
        ▪ if __name__ == ‘__main__’:
            • only runs if the file is executed from the command line
            • will not function if the file is imported
        ▪ sys.argv[X] is a list of X values
        ▪ sys.path lists the modules Python has found in the order Python has found them

Unit Overview
-------------
functions are known as subroutine
  subroutines -- a sequence of instructions that perform a specific task
  subroutines are packaged together as units
    units -- small independent pieces of code

functions give us re-usability

another reason to use functions is abstraction
  users can simply trust that the function works and reuse it
  allows for the function to be easily shared
  allows for changes to be made without the users seeing the changes
